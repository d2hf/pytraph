# pytraph
A few graph algorithms implemented in a python object.

The input of the object is a .txt file

3<br>
A B 1<br>
C D 3<br>
A C 3<br>

where the first line (3) is the number of connections,
A B 1 is a connection from the nodes B and A with a weight of 1.

this implementation DOES NEED to be feeded with letters representing the nodes.
