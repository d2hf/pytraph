# pytraph
A few graph algorithms implemented in a python object.

The input of the object is a .txt file

3
A B 1
C D 3
A C 3

where the first line (3) is the number of connections,
A B 1 is a connection from the nodes B and A with a weight of 1.

this implementation DOES NEED to be feeded with letters representing the nodes.
